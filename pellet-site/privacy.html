        <h1>Privacy Policy – Pellet Usage Monitor</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 2026</p>
        <p>Pellet Usage Monitor (“the App”) is developed by <strong>Dragonfly Developments</strong> (“we”, “us”). This Privacy Policy explains what data the App uses and how it is handled.</p>

        <h2>Summary (Plain English)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Your data is stored securely using Google Firebase (Firestore), hosted in the United Kingdom (London).</li>
          <li>If you use household sharing (Pro feature), your household data is shared with members you invite.</li>
          <li>All users require a Sign in with Apple account for cloud backup and data sync.</li>
          <li>We do not sell your data.</li>
          <li>We do not use third-party advertising or tracking SDKs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data You Provide</h2>
        <p>The App stores the information you enter, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pellet deliveries and hopper refills (transactions)</li>
          <li>Inventory levels</li>
          <li>Boiler details (e.g., model, hopper capacity)</li>
          <li>Service records and reminders</li>
          <li>App settings (units, thresholds, notification preferences)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Purchases</h2>
        <p>If you choose to buy Pellet Usage Monitor Pro, purchases are processed by Apple using StoreKit.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We do not receive your payment card details.</li>
          <li>Apple may associate purchase information with your Apple ID according to Apple’s policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Household Sharing (Pro Feature)</h2>
        <p>If you enable household sharing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Household data is stored in Google Firebase (Firestore), hosted in the United Kingdom.</li>
          <li>Access is limited to participants you invite to the household using invite codes.</li>
          <li>Household data is synced in real time with members you invite.</li>
          <li>Role-based access controls (Owner, Admin, Editor) are enforced server-side.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information, see Google's Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
          <li>Third-party analytics identifiers</li>
          <li>Location data</li>
          <li>Your name or email (Sign in with Apple allows anonymous relay addresses)</li>
          <li>Your contacts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use third-party advertising or tracking services.</p>

        <h2>Notifications</h2>
        <p>The App can schedule notifications (e.g., low hopper, low inventory, service reminders). These notifications are generated by the App and delivered to your device.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>You can delete your data at any time:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the account deletion option in the App to permanently delete your account and all associated data.</li>
          <li>Uninstalling the App removes local data from your device, but cloud data remains until you delete your account.</li>
          <li>If household sharing is enabled, the household owner can remove members and delete shared data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>Your data is protected by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Firebase Security Rules enforcing role-based access to household data.</li>
          <li>Encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (Google Cloud encryption).</li>
          <li>On-device data is protected by iOS security and device encryption.</li>
          <li>Authentication via Sign in with Apple.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Firebase Authentication (Google) -- for user identity via Sign in with Apple.</li>

          <li>StoreKit (Apple) -- for in-app purchases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use third-party advertising, analytics tracking, or data brokers. For information on how Google handles data, see Google's Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
